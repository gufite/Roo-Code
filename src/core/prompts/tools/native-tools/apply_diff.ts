const APPLY_DIFF_DESCRIPTION = `Apply precise, targeted modifications to an existing file using one or more search/replace blocks. This tool is for surgical edits only; the 'SEARCH' block must exactly match the existing content, including whitespace and indentation. To make multiple targeted changes, provide multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the 'diff' parameter. Use the 'read_file' tool first if you are not confident in the exact content to search for.`

const DIFF_PARAMETER_DESCRIPTION = `A string containing one or more search/replace blocks defining the changes. The ':start_line:' is required and indicates the starting line number of the original content. You must not add a start line for the replacement content. Each block must follow this format:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
:start_line:[line_number]
-------
[exact content to find]
=======
[new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE`

- AST_REFACTOR: code restructuring without new behavior
- INTENT_EVOLUTION: new behavior or requirement change`
